## FAQ

**What are the three progress bars?**

The first progress bar represents the progress of the current day.

The second progress bar represents the progress of the current hour.

The third progress bar represents the progress of the current minute.

**Where are the icons stored?**

`assets/img/icons/`

**How do I change the wallpaper(s)?**

The wallpaper changes based upon the current weekday.

You can find them in `assets/img/wallpaper/`

## Installation

First, clone/download the repository somewhere to your computer

* Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/mocklpfdimiadpbgamlgehpgpodggahe
* Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/

After, change your new tab page to the appropriate URL. Locally-stored files use URLs look like `file:///C:/Users/Billy/Desktop/website.html`
