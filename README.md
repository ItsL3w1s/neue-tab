## Neue Tab

New Tab page I made for myself which people were asking to be open-sourced.

### Installation

First, clone/download the repository somewhere to your computer

Then, install a New Tab page changer extension/plugin for your browser, if necessary:

* Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/mocklpfdimiadpbgamlgehpgpodggahe
* Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/

After, change your new tab page to the appropriate URL. Locally-stored files use URLs look like `file:///C:/Users/Billy/Desktop/website.html`

### Configuration

Open `config.js` and add your own categories and links using the template provided.
